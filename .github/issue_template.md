Dear user,
Please understand that at the moment, we are very busy with customer issues 
and some high priority development work. A lot of issues are getting reported. 
Right now we can't keep up and timely respond to all of them. 
We're sorry for that and are expanding our team, if you're looking for a C++ 
job or know somebody who is, please point them to https://nextcloud.com/jobs
Don't forget that Github is not a support system or a place to ask for 
features but only a place to report verified bugs - see nextcloud.com/support 
for support options!
