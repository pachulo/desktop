// Including SDKDDKVer.h defines the highest available Windows platform.

// If you wish to build your application for a previous Windows platform, include WinSDKVer.h and
// set the _WIN32_WINNT macro to the platform you wish to support before including SDKDDKVer.h.

// Note: Here was a #define for windows target version
// e.g. WINVER / _WIN32_WINNT, see https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070411-00/?p=27283
// Unnecessary because we define both in desktop/CMakeLists.txt

#include <SDKDDKVer.h>
